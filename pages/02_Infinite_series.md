The calculation of π was revolutionized by the development of infinite series techniques
in the 16th and 17th centuries. An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite
sequence. Infinite series allowed mathematicians to compute π with much greater
precision than Archimedes and others who used [geometrical techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion#Archimedes).

The two series illustrated above are:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \pi &= 8 \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(4k+1)(4k+3)} \qquad &&\text{by Gottfried Leibniz} \\
  \pi &= \sqrt{6 \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}} \qquad &&\text{by Leonhard Euler}
\end{align*}
$$
