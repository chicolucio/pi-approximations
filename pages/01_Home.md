The number π is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's
circumference to its diameter. It is an irrational number, meaning that it
cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers. Consequently, its
decimal representation never ends, nor enters a permanently repeating pattern.
The first 15 decimals are:

$$
\pi = 3.141592653589793 \ldots
$$

The relation between π and a circle's circumference can be easily seen in the
following animation from Wikipedia:

One may directly compute the arc length of the top half of the unit circle,
given in Cartesian coordinates by the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, as the integral:

$$
\pi = \int\limits_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx
$$

However, calculus is a relatively new math development. Through the centuries,
several π definitions and approximations were proposed. From [polygon 
approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#Method_of_exhaustion)
as developed by Archimedes, passing by 
[infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Infinite_series), 
[Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Monte_Carlo_methods),
until 
[rapidly convergent series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Rapidly_convergent_series).

In this project, some methods to approximate pi will be shown with interactive
graphs. Check them clicking the links on the sidebar.
